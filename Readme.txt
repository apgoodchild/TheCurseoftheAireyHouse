Overview: 
The game is set in 1945. The objective of the game is to find a key to open the front door. The key will not spawn until a specific part of the game has been reached. 
During the first part of the game, when the key is not accessible, it is up to the player to explore the house adding and removing from their stats until the number of 
rooms in play exceed the number of player benefits which have been placed on them. The player has no idea of the event which will occur after that time, and will use their
items and characters to fight the problem or find the key and escape.

The game model is to take several text fils, load them into lists and then through random selection from a wide pool, you can have a game of exploration which is
different every time.
